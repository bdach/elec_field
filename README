ELEC_FIELD()                                                      ELEC_FIELD()

NAME
       elec_field - display a visualization of an electric field

SYNOPSIS
       elec_field -f FILE [-gcs] [-w WIDTH] [-h HEIGHT]

DESCRIPTION
       elec_field  takes  an input file containing 2D coordinates and intensi‐
       ties of point electric charges, and displays them on  the  screen.  The
       hue  of  each pixel represents the intensity of the field, ranging from
       red (highest intensity) to pink (lowest).

       The input files consist of lines with  three  comma-delimited  numbers.
       The lines are of the format x,y,intensity Lines starting with a # char‐
       acter are ignored and treated as comments.

OPTIONS
       -f FILE
              Contains the name of the file to load for intensity info.

       -w WIDTH
              Sets the width of the generated visualization in pixels.

       -h HEIGHT
              Sets the height of the generated visualization in pixels.

       -g     Uses the GPU to render the  visualization.   This  utilizes  the
              CUDA  toolkit and therefore support is only available for NVIDIA
              GPUs.  Enabled by default.

       -c     Uses the CPU to render the visualization.   Warning:  With  high
              output resolutions and big input files this will be VERY slow.

       -s     Silent mode.  Can be used to suppress showing the output window.
              The program exits immediately upon generating the visualization.
              Can  be  used in conjunction with the time(1) utility to compare
              performance.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
       The makefile for the project was adapted from the NVIDIA CUDA samples.

       The GPU compuation uses Thrust for fast reduction.
